			<h2 align="left">How can I recycle?</h2>
			<p align="left">Along with having their household trash picked up 
			for disposal, Mount Desert Island area residents have several 
			options when it comes to reducing what gets thrown out via 
			recycling. </p>
			<h3 align="left">Tremont</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p align="left">The only place available for recycling in 
				Tremont are the metal containers in the lower parking lot of the 
				town office. There are two hoppers there each for plastics, tin 
				cans, papers, and cardboard, respectively. The containers are 
				clearly labeled. It is important for Tremont residents to note 
				that these Dumpsters are solely for recycling. </p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3 align="left">Southwest Harbor</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p align="left">Southwest Harbor residents can do all of their 
				recycling at EMR, located at the transfer station on Long Pond 
				Road. At EMR, they are asked to separate their items into three 
				categories before recycling them. The three categories are 
				newspaper, cardboard, and containers (1 gallon or less). </p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3 align="left">Bar Harbor </h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p align="left">According to
				<a href="http://www.barharbormaine.gov">www.barharbormaine.gov</a>,&nbsp; 
				the town “takes a proactive stance on recycling.” The Bar Harbor 
				Solid Waste and Recycling center accepts white goods, metals, 
				and recyclables such as glass, plastic, paper, tin cans and 
				cardboard to be recycled at the town transfer station. </p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3 align="left">Mount Desert </h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p align="left">In Mount Desert, there is a recycling drop-off 
				center on Sargent Drive that can be used to recycle all 
				traditional materials like metal, glass, plastic, cardboard and 
				paper. </p>
			</blockquote>
			<h3 align="left">Trenton </h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p align="left">For Trenton residents, there are metal 
				containers located in the town office parking lot for each of 
				the following: cardboard, paper, plastic containers and tin 
				cans, and glass jars. The town has a contract with EMR so an 
				alternative option for anyone from Trenton is to take their 
				materials directly to EMR’s facility in Southwest Harbor.</p>
